# Product Context

## Why this project exists

Neon Defense 3D is intended as a compact, approachable example of a real-time game implemented in React and Three.js. It helps teach and demonstrate:

- How to build a game loop within React using `useFrame` and a shared `GameState`.
- State-driven entity management (enemies, towers, projectiles) and how to keep frame logic performant and sane.
- Best-practices for organizing interactive 3D scenes in a component-driven web app.

## Primary users

- Frontend engineers learning real-time systems in React.
- Developers experimenting with Three.js + React integration.
- Contributors who want to extend the game (new towers, enemies, or levels).

## User experience goals

- Fast feedback loop for iterating on gameplay ideas.
- Simple, testable, and modifiable code paths for game logic and rendering.
- Clear extension points and documentation to onboard new contributors.
