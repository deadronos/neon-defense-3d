# Progress Summary

## What works

- Repository scaffolding is present (React + TypeScript + R3F) and core game code exists under `src/game`.
- Unit test harness (Vitest) configured in the repo (`tests/`).
- Memory bank initialization completed (core memory files and task index added).
- **Documentation**: Full JSDoc coverage for all source files and a comprehensive README.

## What's left

- Add design documents for larger features in `memory/designs/`.
- Add more tracked tasks to `memory/tasks/` for upcoming work and bug fixes.

## Known issues

- None recorded in the memory bank; developers should add issues to `memory/progress.md` or tasks as they are discovered.
