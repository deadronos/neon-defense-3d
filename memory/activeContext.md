# Active Context

## Current focus

- Initialize the repository memory bank so agents and contributors have a standard place for project context, tasks, designs, and progress.

## Recent changes

- Created core memory files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.
- Created task index and initial task: `memory/tasks/_index.md`, `memory/tasks/TASK001-initialize-memory-bank.md`.

## Next steps

- Add `progress.md` documenting the current state and remaining work.
- Add lightweight design placeholders in `memory/designs/` and consider adding more tasks to drive work.

## Open decisions

- Keep memory files concise and actionable; expand with more detailed designs and tasks on demand.
