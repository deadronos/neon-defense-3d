# DESIGN001 — Memory bank initialization

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-12-06

## Summary

This design documents the initial layout and files for the repository memory bank. It defines the minimal set of documents required to support agent-driven workflows and human contributors.

## Files created

- `projectbrief.md` — short project summary and acceptance criteria
- `productContext.md` — why the project exists and UX goals
- `systemPatterns.md` — architecture and key patterns
- `techContext.md` — tech stack and developer commands

## Rationale

Keeping the memory bank concise makes it easy for agents and humans to quickly find the current state and next work items. This file should be expanded when adding bigger features or architectural changes.
